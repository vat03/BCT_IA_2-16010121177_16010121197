The following Python code simulates a delay penalty system in a simplified blockchain. It detects miners who hold on to blocks before broadcasting them and applies a penalty to reduce their influence on future block creation. The delay penalty system discourages hidden block mining and aims to prevent attackers from secretly mining longer chains to gain control of the blockchain ultimately helping mitigate the 51% attack on the blockchain.
